# Project 04: Software Development Tools
The purpose of this project is to build and deploy a web application dashboard to a cloud service. 

The tasks need to complete in order to finish the project are as follows:
(1) Creating and managing python virtual environments.
(2) Developing a web application.
(3) Deploying it to a cloud service that will make it accessible to the public.

After doing some analysis, including making plots, of a car advertisement dataset, I decided to make the web application consist of a histogram and a scatterplot made using the dataset.

The link to the GitHub repository is the following:

Furthermore, the link to the app on Render is the following:

If you wish to run the app on your local machine, download the files and then run the streamlit run app.py command using the terminal.
