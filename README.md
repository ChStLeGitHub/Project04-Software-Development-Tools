# Project 04: Software Development Tools

**Objective:** To build and deploy a web application dashboard to a cloud service. 

First, the following tasks were completed:
(1) Creating and managing python virtual environments.
(2) Developing a web application.
(3) Deploying the application to a cloud service that will make it accessible to the public.

After conducting some analysis, including making plots, of a car advertisement dataset, I decided to make the web application consist of a histogram and a scatterplot made using the dataset.

Furthermore, the link to the app on Render is the following:

If you wish to run the app on your local machine, download the project's files and then run the streamlit run app.py command using the terminal.
