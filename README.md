# Software Development Tools

**Objective:** To build and deploy a web application dashboard to a cloud service. 

First, I completed the following tasks:

(1) Create and manage Python virtual environments.

(2) Develop a web application.

(3) Deploy the application to a cloud service that will make it accessible to the public.

Next, I conducted data analysis, including making plots, of a car advertisement dataset. 

Ultimately, I decided to make the web application consist of a histogram and a scatterplot made using the dataset.

The link to the app on Render is the following:

If you wish to run the app on your local machine, download the project's files and run the streamlit run app.py command using the terminal.
